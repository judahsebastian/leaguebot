# LeagueBot

LeagueBot is a discord chatbot that delivers live game data and helpful guides to users. 

# Deployed to Heroku
This version does not include Redux

## App Info

I built LeagueBot's main structure using Node and Discord.js. I used the request node module to make requests to RiotAPI in order to deliver live match and profile data to a user. I also utilize cheerio.js to web-scrape relevant game guides and information not readily available through the RiotAPI. 

### Future updates

The current bot is region locked and not publically available for download. In future iterations I will allow for use in all regions and publish it to a bot database. I plan on improving formatting to make the data more comprehensible to users.
